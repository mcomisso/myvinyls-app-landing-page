Record Store Day 2025 marked the 18th annual celebration of independent record stores, bringing more than 370 exclusive vinyl releases to eager collectors worldwide. With Post Malone serving as this year's ambassador, the event once again proved that vinyl culture is thriving.

## A Special Year

RSD 2025 moved to April 12th — a week earlier than usual to avoid Easter weekend. As Post Malone said in his ambassador statement: "I've loved listening to music for as long as I can remember, but there is nothing better than listening to albums on vinyl."

Here are the releases that had collectors camping outside their favorite stores.

## The Biggest Releases

### Taylor Swift — "Fortnight" 7" White Vinyl

Swift continues her vinyl dominance with an exclusive 7-inch pressing of her single "Fortnight" on pristine white vinyl. Given her track record of RSD releases selling out instantly, this was among the most sought-after items of the day.

### Post Malone — Nirvana Covers Live

The RSD ambassador's viral April 2020 Nirvana tribute finally got the vinyl treatment. This was the first time these covers appeared on vinyl, with proceeds benefiting MusiCares' Addiction Recovery and Mental Health division. A release with both collector appeal and a meaningful cause.

### Charli XCX — Number 1 Angel & "Guess" 7"

A double offering from Charli: her beloved 2017 mixtape *Number 1 Angel* pressed on apple-colored vinyl (appropriately themed), plus a 7-inch featuring both the original and remix versions of her Grammy-nominated Billie Eilish collaboration "Guess."

### Gorillaz — Live from the Apollo Theater (20th Anniversary of Demon Days)

Celebrating two decades of *Demon Days*, Gorillaz released the first-ever vinyl pressing of their legendary 2006 Apollo Theater concert in Harlem. Limited to just 6,500 copies on red vinyl, this was essential for any Gorillaz fan's collection.

### Oasis — Time Flies...1994-2009 Box Set

Oasis made their RSD return with a limited, numbered four-LP box set of their 2010 singles compilation. The first reissue since the original release, featuring multicolored vinyl pressings across all four discs.

## Hidden Gems Worth Hunting

### David Bowie — 2003 Satellite Performance

On September 8, 2003, Bowie performed what was billed as the biggest-ever live interactive satellite music event. RSD 2025 marked the first-ever release of this concert on 180g vinyl.

### Rage Against the Machine — Live on Tour 1993

Completely untouched and unmixed live recordings from RATM's first world tour. Raw, powerful, and never before available on vinyl.

### Wicked Soundtrack — Limited Edition

The smash film soundtrack got a strictly limited pressing: just 2,000 copies on green and pink glitter vinyl. Featuring exclusive RSD cover art, a movie poster, and a bonus track ("Ozdust Duet"), these sold out almost immediately.

### The Killers + Bruce Springsteen — MSG 2022

A vinyl document of The Killers' surprise Madison Square Garden encore with The Boss himself. For fans of either artist, an essential live document.

### Vince Guaraldi Trio — Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown

Unreleased alternate takes from the beloved Peanuts composer, pressed on sky blue vinyl. A touching addition for jazz and animation fans alike.

### Belly — King (First Vinyl Repress Since 1995)

Tanya Donelly's band finally saw their second album return to vinyl after being out of print for nearly 30 years. A cult classic made available again.

### Tori Amos — Live Recordings

Four additional live performances on vinyl for the first time, limited to 2,500 copies with a signed art card, pressed on custard-colored vinyl.

## RSD by the Numbers

- **370+** exclusive releases
- **Thousands** of participating stores worldwide
- **Millions** of dollars in single-day sales
- **40%** of vinyl sales now come from indie stores

## Tips for Future Record Store Days

If you missed out this year, here's how to prepare for future RSDs:

### Before the Day

1. **Check the release list early**: Official lists drop weeks in advance
2. **Make a priority list**: You won't get everything — decide what matters most
3. **Call ahead**: Some stores take want lists or have different policies
4. **Know your budget**: It's easy to overspend in the excitement

### On the Day

1. **Arrive early**: Popular stores see lines hours before opening
2. **Bring cash**: Faster transactions mean faster access to stock
3. **Be flexible**: Your top choice might sell out — have backups
4. **Be kind**: Store staff work incredibly hard on RSD

### After the Day

1. **Check Discogs**: Missed releases often appear (at markup)
2. **Wait a few weeks**: Prices often stabilize after initial frenzy
3. **Visit other stores**: Not every shop sells out of everything
4. **Mark your calendar**: RSD happens twice yearly (April + Black Friday)

## Track Your RSD Finds

Got lucky on Record Store Day? Add your exclusive finds to your [My Vinyls](/) collection. Note the pressing details, catalog numbers, and condition while everything is fresh. Years from now, you'll appreciate having that documentation.

Record Store Day reminds us why physical music matters — the community, the discovery, and the thrill of finding something special. See you next year.
