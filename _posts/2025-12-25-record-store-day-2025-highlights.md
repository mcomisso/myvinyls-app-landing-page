There's something almost absurd about waking up at 5 AM to stand in line outside a record store. You're clutching a coffee, nodding at the other bleary-eyed people in line, all of you silently hoping that one release you really want doesn't sell out before you get inside.

And yet, here we are. Every year. Because Record Store Day is, frankly, kind of magical.

RSD 2025 was the 18th year of this beautiful madness, and it didn't disappoint. Over 370 exclusive releases. Post Malone as the official ambassador (and he seemed genuinely into it, not just doing a promo run). Lines around blocks at indie stores from Tokyo to Toronto.

Here's what had people camping out this year.

## The Ones Everyone Was Hunting

**Taylor Swift's "Fortnight" 7" on white vinyl** was always going to be the headline grabber. Swift's RSD releases have a track record of selling out in minutes, and this one was no different. If you got one, congratulations. If you didn't, Discogs will gladly take your money at markup.

**Post Malone's Nirvana Covers Live** finally made it to vinyl. If you somehow missed it, back in April 2020 Post did a livestream covering Nirvana songs that went viral—like, 4 million concurrent viewers viral. It was unexpectedly good, and weirdly moving. The vinyl pressing benefits MusiCares' addiction recovery and mental health programs, which adds a nice layer of meaning to an already cool release.

**Charli XCX** got a double feature: her 2017 mixtape *Number 1 Angel* on apple-colored vinyl (clever), plus a 7" of "Guess" with the Billie Eilish remix. If you're into the hyperpop world at all, these were essential.

**Gorillaz celebrating 20 years of Demon Days** with the first-ever vinyl pressing of their 2006 Apollo Theater concert. Only 6,500 copies on red vinyl. For a record that influential, from a show that legendary, this felt genuinely special rather than just another anniversary cash-grab.

**Oasis dropped a Time Flies box set**—their 2010 singles compilation spread across four LPs on multicolored vinyl, numbered and limited. With the band reunion dominating headlines, the timing couldn't have been better.

## The Ones Collectors Were Quietly Very Excited About

Beyond the big names, RSD always delivers some gems that don't make the mainstream news but had dedicated fans losing their minds:

**David Bowie's 2003 satellite performance**—billed at the time as the biggest live interactive satellite music event ever—finally saw vinyl release. Never before available in any physical format. For Bowie completists, this was the find.

**Rage Against the Machine live recordings from their 1993 tour**, completely raw and unmixed. Not a polished live album—actual document of what those early shows sounded like. Visceral stuff.

**The Wicked soundtrack** got a limited pressing of just 2,000 copies on green and pink glitter vinyl, with exclusive artwork and a bonus track. These were gone basically instantly.

**The Killers and Bruce Springsteen at Madison Square Garden 2022**—a vinyl document of that surprise encore. If you love either artist, this was special.

**Vince Guaraldi Trio's alternate takes from A Boy Named Charlie Brown**—unreleased recordings from the beloved Peanuts composer, pressed on sky blue vinyl. Perfect for jazz heads and animation nerds alike.

**Belly's "King" finally back on vinyl** after nearly 30 years out of print. Cult classic status confirmed.

**Tori Amos live recordings** limited to 2,500 copies with a signed art card. On custard-colored vinyl, because why not.

## The Numbers Behind the Madness

This year saw 370+ exclusive releases across participating stores worldwide. Independent record stores now account for around 40% of all vinyl sales—RSD has genuinely helped keep these places alive and thriving.

Stores reported lines forming hours before opening. Some shops saw their biggest single-day sales ever. And the energy inside these stores—strangers bonding over their finds, staff running on adrenaline and caffeine, that shared excitement—it's hard to replicate anywhere else in retail.

## Lessons for Next Time

For anyone who came up empty-handed or just discovered RSD exists:

**Weeks before:**
Get the official release list as soon as it drops and make a priority list. You won't get everything you want—decide what actually matters versus what would just be nice to have. Some stores take want lists in advance; call yours and ask.

**The night before:**
Know your budget and stick to it. RSD has a way of making you suddenly need things you didn't know existed. Prepare cash—faster transactions mean more time browsing before things sell out.

**On the day:**
Yes, you need to arrive early. Like, embarrassingly early. The bigger releases disappear fast. Be flexible—your number one pick might sell out, but something else might catch your eye. And please be nice to the staff; they're working incredibly hard to make this day happen.

**After the day:**
Don't panic if you missed something. Prices on Discogs spike immediately after RSD but often settle down over the following weeks. Check other stores in your area—not every shop sells out of everything. And remember: there's always another RSD in six months (April and Black Friday).

## Why It Still Matters

There's something almost defiant about Record Store Day in 2025. In an age when every song ever recorded is available instantly on your phone, thousands of people still wake up early to buy physical objects from small businesses. They wait in line. They pay premium prices. They go home with something they could technically access for free on Spotify.

But that misses the point. It's never really been about the music alone. It's about the experience—the community, the discovery, the tactile reality of holding something real. It's about supporting the weird little shops that have been the heartbeat of music culture for decades.

One store owner put it this way: "Record Store Day reminds people that record stores exist. And then they keep coming back all year."

That's the real magic. The lines form in April and November, but the relationships—with the stores, with the music, with the hobby—last a lot longer.

See you next year in line.
