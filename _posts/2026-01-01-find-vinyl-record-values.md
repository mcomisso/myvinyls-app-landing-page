One of the most common questions we hear from collectors is: "How much is my record worth?" Whether you're buying, selling, or just curious about your collection's value, knowing how to accurately price vinyl is essential. Here's how My Vinyls makes it easy.

## Understanding Vinyl Pricing

Record values are influenced by several factors:

### 1. Pressing Information
Not all copies of an album are equal. A first pressing of *Led Zeppelin I* from 1969 can be worth hundreds, while a recent reissue might cost $25.

### 2. Condition
The condition of both the vinyl and the sleeve dramatically affects value:
- **Mint (M)**: Perfect, unplayed condition
- **Near Mint (NM)**: Almost perfect, minimal signs of handling
- **Very Good Plus (VG+)**: Light marks that don't affect playback
- **Very Good (VG)**: Audible surface noise but plays through
- **Good (G)**: Heavy wear, plays with significant noise

### 3. Rarity
Limited editions, promotional copies, colored vinyl, and deleted pressings command premium prices.

### 4. Market Demand
Popular artists and genres tend to hold value better. Classic rock, jazz, and hip-hop often see strong prices.

## Using My Vinyls to Check Values

My Vinyls integrates directly with Discogs, giving you access to real market data for millions of releases.

### Scanning a Record

1. Open My Vinyls and tap the **scan** button
2. Point your camera at the barcode
3. Select the correct pressing from the results
4. View pricing data instantly

The app shows you:
- **Lowest price** currently listed
- **Median price** from recent sales
- **Highest price** for collector-grade copies

### Checking Your Collection's Worth

To see your total collection value:

1. Go to **Collection** in the app
2. Tap the **Statistics** icon
3. View your estimated collection value

> **Note**: Values update automatically based on Discogs market data, so your collection worth may fluctuate over time.

## Tips for Accurate Pricing

### 1. Match the Exact Pressing

The same album can have dozens of different pressings. Pay attention to:
- Catalog number (usually on the spine and label)
- Country of origin
- Label variations
- Matrix/runout codes (etched near the center)

### 2. Be Honest About Condition

Overgrading is common when selling. When in doubt, grade conservatively. A "VG+" that's really "VG" will disappoint buyers and damage your reputation.

### 3. Consider Recent Sales

Listed prices don't always reflect actual sales. In My Vinyls, you can see both current listings and recent sale prices for a more accurate picture.

### 4. Watch for Trends

Some records appreciate over time, especially after:
- An artist's passing
- Anniversary reissues generating interest
- Viral moments on social media
- Inclusion in popular films or shows

## Identifying Valuable Records

Here are some signs a record might be worth more than you think:

- **Colored or picture discs**: Often limited editions
- **Promo stamps**: "DJ Copy" or "Not for Sale" labels
- **Original inner sleeves**: With lyrics, photos, or artwork
- **Inserts**: Posters, stickers, or booklets still included
- **Unusual labels**: Test pressings or withdrawn versions

## Building Value Over Time

If you're collecting with an eye on value:

1. **Buy quality over quantity** — A few excellent condition records beat many worn copies
2. **Document everything** — Use My Vinyls to keep records of purchase prices and conditions
3. **Store properly** — Good storage preserves value
4. **Buy what you love** — The best collections are built on passion, not speculation
