Remember record clubs? Columbia House and BMG offered twelve CDs for a penny (plus years of overpriced commitments). Today's vinyl subscription services are different — curated discovery, exclusive pressings, and flexibility that respects collectors.

Whether you want expertly selected classics, personalized picks based on your Spotify data, or adventurous surprises, there's a subscription for you.

## The Major Players

### Vinyl Me, Please (VMP)

**The standard-bearer for vinyl subscriptions.**

VMP is perhaps the most established record club, with a reputation for quality curation and exclusive pressings.

**What you get:**
- Deluxe edition vinyl (often exclusive color variant)
- Collectible art print
- Exclusive liner notes
- Access to member store with additional exclusive titles

**Subscription options:**
- **Essentials:** Wide-ranging monthly selection — $36/month
- **Classics:** Jazz, blues, and soul focus
- **Rap & Hip Hop:** Genre-specific curation

**The VMP advantage:** Monthly releases are announced before shipping, so you can swap for an alternative if the selection doesn't appeal.

**Best for:** Collectors who want quality pressings with extras, plus access to an exclusive catalog.

### Black Box Record Club

An offshoot of Dualtone Records, Magnolia focuses on a specific aesthetic — and does it well.

**What you get:**
- Limited edition colored vinyl

### VNYL

**Affordable discovery you can customize.**

VNYL offers a balance of personalization and value. Create a music profile via Spotify or questionnaire, and they match you with appropriate selections.

**What you get:**

### Vinyl Moon

**The mixtape club.**

**What you get:**
- "Mixtape on vinyl" format
- Up-and-coming musicians
- Beautiful colored vinyl
- Unique artwork from visual artists

**Best for:** Adventurous listeners who want to discover new artists, not just new-to-them classics.

### Third Man Records Vault

**Jack White's exclusive releases.**

Even if you're not a Jack White devotee, Vault subscriptions have proven valuable. The inaugural box included a mono pressing of The White Stripes' *Icky Thump* — copies now sell for nearly $1,000 on Discogs.

**Best for:** UK-based collectors who love surprises and have broad taste.

### VinylBox (UK)

**Price:** £34-44/month depending on tier

**Best for:** UK collectors who want themed selections.

### Vinyl Postcard Record Club

Something different entirely: a 5×7-inch postcard that actually plays on your turntable. One song monthly from a current band.

**Price:** $5/month or $48 annually

**Best for:** Novelty collectors and those who appreciate the format's quirkiness.

## How to Choose

### Consider Your Goals

**Discovery vs. collection building:** Do you want to hear new things, or acquire specific quality pressings?

**Genre focus:** Are you open to anything, or do you want genre-specific curation?

**Budget:** Monthly costs range from $5 to $75+ — what's sustainable?

**Exclusivity:** Do you care about exclusive variants, or is the music enough?

### Questions to Ask

- Can I preview/swap monthly selections?
- What's the cancellation policy?
- Are pressings exclusive or available elsewhere?
- How is shipping handled (and is it included)?
- What happens if a record arrives damaged?

### Start Small

Most services allow month-to-month subscriptions. Try one for a few months before committing annually. The "right" subscription is the one that consistently sends records you actually play.

## The Value Proposition

Vinyl subscriptions work when they:
- Introduce you to music you wouldn't find yourself
- Provide pressings worth more than the subscription cost
- Fit your listening habits and taste
- Feel like gifts rather than obligations

They don't work when:
- Records pile up unplayed
- Selections consistently miss your taste
- You'd rather choose your own purchases
- The cost doesn't match the value

## Track Your Subscriptions

With [My Vinyls](/), catalog subscription arrivals alongside your other purchases. Note which services consistently deliver records you love, and which might be worth canceling. Your collection data tells the story of what works.

The best subscription is one where opening the package feels exciting, not obligatory. Find yours.
