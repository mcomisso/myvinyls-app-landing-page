In 1939, two German-Jewish immigrants, Alfred Lion and Max Margulis, and soon joined by photographer Francis Wolff, created what would become the most revered jazz label in history. Blue Note Records is, to many, the platonic ideal of a jazz label — and for collectors, it represents both the ultimate challenge and the ultimate reward.

## Why Blue Note Matters

Throughout its storied history, Blue Note released more genre-defining albums than not. Most jazz titans from the 1950s to the 1970s had a Blue Note period:

- John Coltrane
- Herbie Hancock
- Art Blakey
- Joe Henderson
- Wayne Shorter
- Tony Williams
- Thelonious Monk

The label's distinctive aesthetic — Reid Miles' iconic cover designs, Francis Wolff's atmospheric photographs, Rudy Van Gelder's legendary engineering — created a complete artistic vision that elevated jazz records into collectible art objects.

## The Blue Note 1500 Series

Between 1955 and 1958, Blue Note became the standard bearer for post-bebop modern jazz with the legendary 1500 series. These 98 LPs define what collectors chase most aggressively.

**Why the 1500 series matters:**

- Post-bebop jazz at its creative peak
- Original pressings are true historical artifacts
- Relatively small initial print runs
- Many weren't reissued for decades
- First mono pressings are the holy grail

**The cost of entry is significant.** An original pressing of Lee Morgan's self-titled Blue Note LP (BLP 1557) sold for $4,177 in 2017. Pristine copies of sought-after titles routinely reach five figures.

## Identifying Original Pressings

The difference between an original Blue Note and a reissue can be thousands of dollars. Here's how to tell them apart.

### Label Addresses

Blue Note's address changed over time, and the label reflects this:

**767 Lexington Avenue, New York:** Albums 1501-1563 (early 1500 series)

**47 West 63rd, New York:** Albums 1564-1599 and 4001-4080

**"New York, USA" labels:** Albums 4081 through 4226 (the final original release, Don Cherry's "Complete Communion")

**Red flags:** If the label reads "A Division Of Liberty Records, Inc" or "A Division Of United Artists," you're looking at a later repress.

### The "Ear" Mark

This is crucial: **all original (pre-Liberty) Blue Note pressings have a small "ear" mark in the dead wax**. It looks like a cursive "P" — because that's what it is. This mark was made by the mastering engineer.

No ear mark = not an original pressing (regardless of label appearance).

### Deep Grooves

Many original Blue Notes feature a noticeable "deep groove" — a wide, ungrooved area around the label. However, you can't determine vintage by deep grooves alone. Some originals don't have them; some reissues do.

Deep grooves are one data point, not proof.

### Label Colors

- **Blue and white:** Original era
- **Black and light blue:** Late 1960s (Liberty era)
- **All blue:** Mid-to-late 1970s

### Other Identifiers

- "Blue Note Inc" with registered trademark symbol = later pressing
- Gatefold sleeves on early titles = reissue (originals were single sleeves)
- West Coast address = definitely not original

## The Most Valuable Blue Note Records

Nearly all first-edition Blue Note records are valuable, but some stand above the rest.

### *True Blue* by Tina Brooks

The white whale of Blue Note collecting. The label reportedly pressed fewer than 1,000 copies, making it extraordinarily rare. Finding one in any condition is noteworthy; finding one in excellent condition is a collector's dream achieved.

### *Soul Station* by Hank Mobley

Tied for the second most expensive Blue Note sold on Discogs. A perfect confluence of musical greatness and pressing rarity.

### Other High-Value Titles

- **Eric Dolphy:** *Out to Lunch!*
- **Herbie Hancock:** *Maiden Voyage*
- **Lee Morgan:** *The Sidewinder*
- **Wayne Shorter:** *Speak No Evil*
- **Art Blakey:** *Moanin'*

## Twelve Tips for Collecting Blue Note

### 1. Start with What You Love

Don't buy based solely on value. The best collections reflect genuine musical passion.

### 2. Learn the Labels

Study Blue Note's label evolution until you can identify eras at a glance.

### 3. Inspect the Dead Wax

Matrix numbers and ear marks tell the real story.

### 4. Condition Is Everything

A VG original isn't necessarily better than a NM reissue for listening purposes.

### 5. Consider Japanese Pressings

King Records and Toshiba Japanese pressings are highly regarded for both sound quality and packaging. They're more affordable than US originals while delivering excellent audio.

### 6. The OBI Adds Value

Japanese pressings with intact OBI strips command premiums.

### 7. Buy the Book

Frederick Cohen's *Blue Note Records: A Guide For Identifying Original Pressings* is the definitive resource. It covers label design, mastering stamps, cover seams, and countless other details.

### 8. Study Mono vs. Stereo

Early Blue Note stereo pressings were often mastered by Rudy Van Gelder himself. Both versions can be desirable.

### 9. Check Cover Construction

Original covers have specific seam patterns and printing characteristics.

### 10. Verify Everything

Ask sellers for dead wax photos and detailed condition reports.

### 11. Be Patient

The right copy at the right price will appear. Don't overpay out of impatience.

### 12. Build Relationships

Established jazz dealers can source records and alert you to opportunities.

## Modern Blue Note Reissues

For collectors who love the music but can't afford originals, excellent options exist.

### Blue Note 80 Vinyl Reissue Series

For Blue Note's 80th anniversary, the label launched premium reissue programs:

**Tone Poet Series:** Audiophile-grade 180g vinyl, all-analog mastering, gatefold sleeves, superior packaging. Curated by Joe Harley.

**Classic Vinyl Series:** Mid-priced 180g pressings, curated by Don Was and Cem Kurosman.

These reissues use high-quality vinyl and careful mastering. For pure listening enjoyment, they're hard to beat.

### Music Matters Reissues

Audiophile label Music Matters has released stunning Blue Note reissues on 45 RPM across two discs. Expensive but sonically remarkable.

## Building Your Blue Note Collection

**For beginners:**
1. Start with well-regarded reissues to learn the music
2. Note which albums you return to repeatedly
3. Upgrade those specific titles to better pressings

**For serious collectors:**
1. Define your scope (era, artist, budget)
2. Track prices across platforms
3. Attend record shows and estate sales
4. Join collector communities for alerts

**For completists:**
1. Acknowledge you're chasing something difficult
2. Budget accordingly
3. Accept condition compromises for rare titles
4. Document everything

With [My Vinyls](/), catalog every Blue Note in your collection with the details that matter: pressing information, matrix codes, label variation, and condition. Note which pressings you prefer and which you're still hunting. Your Blue Note journey deserves proper documentation.

Blue Note records represent the pinnacle of jazz collecting — challenging, expensive, and deeply rewarding. Whether you're buying your first Herbie Hancock reissue or hunting for an original Tina Brooks, you're participating in one of collecting's great traditions.
