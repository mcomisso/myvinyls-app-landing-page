# About My Vinyls

My Vinyls is an iOS app built for people who love collecting records. It helps you catalog what you own, scan new additions in seconds, and keep everything synced with Discogs so your collection stays accurate everywhere.

The app was created by Matteo Comisso, a vinyl collector who wanted a fast, beautiful way to manage a growing library without the friction of spreadsheets or clunky tools. My Vinyls focuses on speed, clarity, and delight so you can spend less time organizing and more time listening.

If you have ideas or feedback, I would love to hear from you. Visit the Contact page to get in touch.
