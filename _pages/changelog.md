#### Bug fixes
- The number of records in a folder was a bit flickery - it's now fixed and displays the correct amount for any folder you're browsing.

#### Bug fixes
- Fixes Artists images, sometimes were black on black.
- I got told that some French translations were nonsense. Thanks to my friend Antoine for pointing them out - the app should make more sense now. Unless he tricked me and My Vinyls is now displaying gibberish.

# **Version 3.1.1**

#### Bug fixes
- Removes the Platinum sticker for everyone that purchased either the lifetime unlock or a subscription. THANK YOU! <3

# **Version 3.1.0**

#### Improvements
- Offline mode is here! My Vinyls is more tolerant when there is no connection. If you browsed your collection just before entering a tunnel, you'll still be able to browse and stare at those beautiful graphics. Also works if you're hiking on a mountain, or in the tube. Or anywhere where there's little to no reception.
- Apple Music Integration! A new button will appear when My Vinyls is able to play your record on Apple Music. Simply press play and enjoy your album. This requires a valid Apple Music subscription to work.

#### Bug Fixes

- Privacy Policy url updated

# **Version 3.0.2**

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a loop in fetching images: in a rare situation where a record has images, My Vinyls kept trying. Forever. That's a bit too much, so the app is now aware that there might be those situation happening.
- There was a probelm with uninstalling and re-installing the app, fixed in 3.0.1. Not only that worked well, but My Vinyls can detect and self-recover from that issue.

# **Version 3.0.1**

#### Bug Fixes
